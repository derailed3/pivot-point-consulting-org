# Proven Patterns

This document is automatically updated by `/summarize-feedback`.
It captures patterns that produce high-quality outputs and anti-patterns to avoid.

## General Patterns

- Always start from the appropriate template in `templates/`
- Use `[PLACEHOLDER: description]` for any information not provided
- Include quantified results where possible (metrics, percentages, timeframes)
- Follow one-sentence-per-line formatting for cleaner git diffs

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not fabricate organizational facts, client names, or financial figures
- Do not skip YAML frontmatter on any document
- Do not include PHI, PII, or real client-identifiable data
