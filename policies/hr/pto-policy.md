# Paid Time Off Policy

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish Pivot Point Consulting's Paid Time Off (PTO) program, which provides workforce members with flexible time away from work for rest, personal activities, vacation, and personal needs. Pivot Point Consulting recognizes that regular time away from work is essential for maintaining the well-being, productivity, and engagement of our workforce.

This policy outlines the PTO accrual schedule, request and approval process, carryover rules, and other leave categories available to eligible workforce members.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All regular full-time employees of Pivot Point Consulting.
- Regular part-time employees working [PLACEHOLDER: number] or more hours per week, who accrue PTO on a prorated basis.
- This policy does not apply to temporary employees, interns, or independent contractors unless otherwise specified in their engagement agreement.

## 3. PTO Accrual

### 3.1 Accrual Schedule

PTO accrues on a per-pay-period basis according to the following schedule. Accrual rates are based on continuous years of service with Pivot Point Consulting.
