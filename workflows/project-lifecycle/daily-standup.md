# Workflow: Daily Standup

## Purpose

The daily standup keeps the team aligned on progress, surfaces blockers early, and promotes accountability.
This short synchronous check-in ensures everyone knows what is happening across the engagement and can offer or request help in a timely manner.

## Trigger

- **Trigger Event:** Daily at the scheduled time
- **Trigger Source:** Recurring calendar invite
- **Frequency:** Every business day (Monday through Friday)

## Roles

| Role | Responsibility in Workflow | Person/Team |
|------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Scrum Master / Delivery Lead | Facilitates the standup, tracks blockers, enforces timebox | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Team Members | Report progress, plan for the day, raise blockers | [PLACEHOLDER] |
| Product Owner (optional) | Listens for priority shifts, provides quick clarifications | [PLACEHOLDER] |

## Inputs

- Sprint board with current item statuses
- Previous day's standup notes (if documented)
- Known blockers or dependency updates

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Open the Standup

- **Owner:** Scrum Master / Delivery Lead
- **Description:** Start the meeting on time regardless of who has joined.
Share the sprint board on screen (or reference the board link for remote teams).
Remind the team of the sprint goal if needed.
- **Tools/Systems:** [PLACEHOLDER: video conferencing tool], [PLACEHOLDER: project management tool]
- **SLA:** 1 minute

### Step 2: Individual Updates

- **Owner:** Each Team Member
- **Description:** Each team member answers three questions:
  1. **What did I accomplish yesterday?** -- Reference specific sprint items or tasks.
  2. **What will I work on today?** -- State planned focus areas.
  3. **Are there any blockers?** -- Identify anything preventing progress.
Keep each update to 1-2 minutes maximum.
Do not problem-solve during updates; note items for follow-up.
- **Tools/Systems:** Sprint board for visual reference
- **SLA:** 1-2 minutes per person (entire round should not exceed 12 minutes for a team of 6)

### Step 3: Document Blockers

- **Owner:** Scrum Master / Delivery Lead
- **Description:** Record all blockers mentioned during the standup.
Assign an owner for each blocker resolution.
Set a target resolution time (same day preferred).
- **Tools/Systems:** [PLACEHOLDER: project management tool] or shared document
- **SLA:** 2 minutes

### Step 4: Close the Standup

- **Owner:** Scrum Master / Delivery Lead
- **Description:** Summarize key blockers and who is addressing them.
Announce any relevant schedule changes or upcoming meetings.
Remind the team to update the sprint board throughout the day.
End the meeting on time.
- **Tools/Systems:** Calendar, [PLACEHOLDER: communication tool]
- **SLA:** 1 minute

### Step 5: Follow Up on Blockers (Post-Standup)

- **Owner:** Scrum Master / Delivery Lead
- **Description:** Immediately after standup, schedule or initiate follow-up conversations for any blockers.
Escalate blockers that cannot be resolved within the team to the engagement manager or client contact.
Update blocker status in the project management tool.
- **Tools/Systems:** [PLACEHOLDER: communication tool], [PLACEHOLDER: project management tool]
- **SLA:** Within 2 hours of standup

## Outputs

- Updated sprint board reflecting current progress
- Blocker log with owners and target resolution dates
- Team awareness of daily priorities and dependencies

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All present team members have provided their update
- [ ] All blockers are documented with an assigned owner
- [ ] Meeting completed within 15 minutes
- [ ] Sprint board reflects current item statuses

## Ground Rules

1. **Start on time.** Do not wait for latecomers; they can review notes afterward.
2. **Stand up (if in person).** Standing encourages brevity.
3. **No problem-solving.** Take discussions offline to a "parking lot" session.
4. **Update the board first.** Team members should update their items before standup so the board is current.
5. **Camera on (remote).** Encourages engagement and accountability.
6. **Respect the timebox.** 15 minutes maximum, no exceptions.

## Async Standup Alternative

For distributed teams across multiple time zones, an asynchronous standup may be used.

| Aspect | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Format | Video call | Written post in [PLACEHOLDER: communication tool] |
| Timing | Fixed daily time | Post by [PLACEHOLDER: agreed time] in your time zone |
| Blocker handling | Discussed live | Tagged for immediate follow-up |
| Sprint board | Shared on screen | Link posted with update |

> **Note:** Asynchronous standups require more discipline.
> The Scrum Master should review all posts daily and follow up on any blockers within 2 hours.

## Exceptions

| Exception | Handling Procedure | Escalation |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Scrum Master unavailable | Designate a backup facilitator in advance | Team self-facilitates |
| Team member absent | Review their board items; follow up via message | Scrum Master checks in |
| Critical blocker requiring immediate action | End standup early; convene relevant parties | Engagement Manager |
| Holiday or company event | Cancel standup; resume next business day | N/A |

## Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|--------|--------------------|-----------|
| Standup duration | 15 minutes or less | Time tracking | Daily |
| Attendance rate | 90%+ of team members present | Head count | Weekly |
| Blocker resolution time | Same day (within 8 hours) | Blocker log timestamps | Weekly |
| Board update compliance | 100% of items current at standup time | Board audit | Weekly |
