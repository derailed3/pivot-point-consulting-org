# How To: Onboard a New Hire

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for hiring managers and HR to onboard a new Pivot Point Consulting team member.
It covers everything from account creation to the 30/60/90 day check-in cycle.
For the full process map with timelines and roles, see the [New Hire Onboarding Workflow](../../workflows/onboarding/new-hire-onboarding.md).

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Offer has been accepted and start date is confirmed
- [ ] Signed offer letter and employment agreement on file
- [ ] Hiring manager has been designated
- [ ] IT has been notified of the incoming hire (at least 2 weeks before start date)
- [ ] Role description and team assignment are finalized

## Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Account Invite

1. Navigate to the PPC GitHub organization at [PLACEHOLDER: GitHub org URL].
2. Go to **Settings > People > Invite member**.
3. Enter the new hire's email address.
4. Assign the appropriate team(s) based on their role:
   - `all-staff` -- all employees
   - `consulting` -- consultants and delivery team
   - `operations` -- internal operations staff
   - [PLACEHOLDER: additional team names as applicable]
5. Set the repository permission level (typically "Write" for contributors).
6. Send the invitation.
7. Follow up with the new hire to confirm they accepted the invite.

> **Note:** The new hire will need a GitHub account.
> If they do not have one, include instructions for creating a free account in the welcome email.

### Step 2: Follow the New Hire Onboarding Workflow

Execute all steps in the [New Hire Onboarding Workflow](../../workflows/onboarding/new-hire-onboarding.md).
This includes:

- **Pre-start:** Equipment provisioning, account creation, welcome email
- **Day 1:** Orientation, policies review, tool access verification
- **Week 1:** Team introductions, HIPAA training, KB onboarding, mentor assignment
- **Month 1:** Role-specific training, first project, 30-day check-in

Use the onboarding checklist in the workflow document to track progress.

### Step 3: Schedule HIPAA Training

1. Log in to [PLACEHOLDER: LMS or training platform].
2. Enroll the new hire in the "HIPAA Privacy and Security Fundamentals" course.
3. Set a completion deadline of **end of Week 1**.
4. Notify the new hire of the enrollment and deadline.
5. After completion, verify the certificate is on file with HR.

HIPAA training is mandatory for all PPC employees.
No team member may access client systems containing ePHI until training is complete.

> **Important:** If the new hire will be working with a specific EHR platform (Epic, Oracle Health, etc.), also enroll them in platform-specific security training.

### Step 4: Assign Knowledge Base Onboarding

1. Share the link to `docs/tutorials/getting-started.md` with the new hire.
2. Walk them through the guide in a pairing session or let them self-serve.
3. Have them complete the following exercises:
   - Clone the repository locally
   - Set up MkDocs for local preview (optional but recommended)
   - Browse the directory structure
   - Make a small contribution (e.g., add themselves to a team page or fix a typo)
   - Submit their first PR
4. Review and merge their first PR promptly to reinforce the workflow.

### Step 5: Set Up Recurring 1:1 Meetings

1. Schedule a recurring 1:1 meeting between the new hire and their hiring manager.
2. Recommended cadence:
   - **First month:** Weekly (30 minutes)
   - **Months 2-3:** Biweekly (30 minutes)
   - **After 90 days:** Per team standard (typically biweekly or monthly)
3. Also schedule 1:1s between the new hire and their assigned mentor:
   - **First month:** Weekly (30 minutes)
   - **Months 2-3:** Biweekly (30 minutes)

### Step 6: Conduct 30/60/90 Day Check-Ins

Each check-in is a structured conversation between the hiring manager and the new hire.

**30-Day Check-In:**
- How are you settling in?
- Do you have the tools and access you need?
- How was the onboarding experience?
- What questions do you have about your role?
- Feedback on early work product

**60-Day Check-In:**
- Are you feeling productive and integrated with the team?
- What is going well and what could be better?
- Are there skills or training gaps to address?
- Goal setting for the remainder of the probationary period

**90-Day Check-In:**
- Overall assessment of fit and performance
- Formalize goals for the next quarter
- Transition from onboarding mode to standard performance management
- Solicit feedback on the onboarding process for continuous improvement

Document each check-in and store notes in [PLACEHOLDER: HRIS system] or the knowledge base.

## Expected Outcome

- New hire is fully set up with all required accounts, tools, and access
- HIPAA training is completed and certified
- New hire has made their first knowledge base contribution
- Regular 1:1 cadence is established with both manager and mentor
- 30/60/90 day check-ins are scheduled and conducted on time
- New hire feels welcomed, informed, and productive

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| GitHub invite not received | Email went to spam or wrong address | Resend invite; check email address spelling |
| HIPAA training platform inaccessible | Account not provisioned or license issue | Contact [PLACEHOLDER: LMS administrator] |
| New hire struggling with Git | No prior Git experience | Schedule a dedicated Git tutorial session; pair with mentor |
| 30-day check-in reveals dissatisfaction | Onboarding gaps, unclear expectations, or cultural mismatch | Document concerns; create action plan; involve HR if needed |
| Equipment not ready by start date | Late ordering or shipping delay | Provide temporary loaner equipment; escalate to IT Manager |
