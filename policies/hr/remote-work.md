# Remote Work Policy

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish Pivot Point Consulting's requirements and expectations for workforce members who work remotely, whether on a full-time, hybrid, or occasional basis. As a healthcare IT consulting firm that handles Protected Health Information (PHI) and operates under stringent regulatory requirements including HIPAA, HITRUST, and SOC 2, Pivot Point Consulting must ensure that remote work arrangements maintain the same level of security, productivity, and compliance as in-office work.

This policy addresses the unique security and operational challenges of remote work while supporting workforce flexibility and work-life balance.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All Pivot Point Consulting workforce members who perform work outside of Pivot Point Consulting's physical offices or client sites, including full-time remote workers, hybrid workers, and those working remotely on an occasional or ad hoc basis.
- All employees, contractors, consultants, interns, and temporary staff.
- All devices, systems, and networks used for remote work, whether company-issued or personal (BYOD).
- All data accessed, created, processed, or transmitted during remote work, with particular emphasis on PHI and ePHI.

This policy does not apply to travel-related work or work performed at client sites, which is governed by client site policies and the applicable engagement agreement.

## 3. Eligibility

### 3.1 Eligibility Criteria

Remote work eligibility is determined based on:

- **Job Function**: The nature of the workforce member's role and whether it can be effectively performed remotely. Roles requiring frequent in-person client interaction, physical equipment access, or other on-site activities may not be eligible for full-time remote work.
- **Performance**: Workforce members must be in good standing with satisfactory performance evaluations. New employees may be required to complete an in-office onboarding period of [PLACEHOLDER: number] days/weeks before transitioning to remote work.
- **Security Capability**: The workforce member must be able to meet all security requirements outlined in this policy, including secure workspace, network connectivity, and equipment standards.

### 3.2 Approval Process

1. Workforce member submits a remote work request through [PLACEHOLDER: request system/process].
2. Manager reviews the request and assesses eligibility based on the criteria above.
3. For arrangements involving access to PHI/ePHI, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer must confirm that the remote environment meets security requirements.
4. Approved arrangements are documented and maintained by [PLACEHOLDER: HR or applicable department].

### 3.3 Temporary Remote Work

Temporary remote work (e.g., inclement weather, illness, personal circumstances) may be approved by the direct manager on a case-by-case basis without the formal approval process, provided the workforce member can meet security requirements.
